# Git for collaboration example repository

This is an example Git repository that is used as part of the
[Git for Collaboration](https://chryswoods.com/git_collaboration)
workshop. It's aim is to help you learn how to use Git and GitHub
to work collaboratively as part of a team.

This repository contains a variety of files and will change
over time as we run the workshop.

The project involves planning the refurbishment and installation
of a new kitchen.

I made a change.
